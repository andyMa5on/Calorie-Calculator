### Calorie-Calculator

This was my first ever project whilst I was studying `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `J-Query`.

The aim wasn't to create something fancy looking, it's focus was using `JavaScript` and `J-Query` to take validate the user entered form data, do the calculations necessary and then manipulate the Dom to show the result.
